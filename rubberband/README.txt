Rubber Band
===========

An audio time-stretching and pitch-shifting library and utility program.

Rubber Band is a library and utility program that permits changing the
tempo and pitch of an audio recording independently of one another.

See http://breakfastquay.com/rubberband/ for more information.

the file COPYING for more information. Please refer to
http://breakfastquay.com/rubberband/ for source code and for details
about commercial licences.

This package contains a build of the Rubber Band command-line tool for
Windows.  This program is built using the Rubber Band library, and
makes use of libsndfile (http://www.mega-nerd.com/libsndfile/) for
audio file loading.


Using the Rubber Band command-line tool
=======================================

The basic incantation is

  $ rubberband -t <timeratio> -p <pitchratio> <infile.wav> <outfile.wav>

For example,

  $ rubberband -t 1.5 -p 2.0 test.wav output.wav

stretches the file test.wav to 50% longer than its original duration,
shifts it up in pitch by one octave, and writes the output to output.wav.

Several further options are available: run "rubberband -h" for help.
In particular, different types of music may benefit from different
"crispness" options (-c <n> where <n> is from 0 to 6).
